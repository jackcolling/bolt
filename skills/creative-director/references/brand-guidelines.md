# Bolt Brand Guidelines Reference

Quick reference for reviewing creative work against brand standards.

## Brand Essence

Bolt is a modern, energy-focused brand. The visual identity conveys power, speed, and innovation while remaining approachable and playful.

## Tone of Voice

### Three Pillars

1. **Thoughtfully Concise**
   - Say more with less
   - Every word earns its place
   - Avoid jargon and fluff

2. **Knowingly Playful**
   - Clever, not childish
   - Confident wit
   - Surprising but appropriate

3. **Comfortably at Ease**
   - Relaxed confidence
   - Never aggressive or pushy
   - Inviting and warm

### Voice Checklist
- [ ] Could this be shorter without losing meaning?
- [ ] Is there a more interesting way to say this?
- [ ] Does it sound like a conversation, not a lecture?
